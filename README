Massive Update:
Log 1.0.0 - Fixed Background, Added Edit And Delete Button, UI Cleanup, Added Notifications.

Note: This isn't considered a massive update, to me it is though because of how far it has gone. There is more to come, don't worry.

Log 1.0.1 - Cannot chat without entering a username -> Should have been fixed awhile ago.
Future Updates - Add profile pictures?, etc.
